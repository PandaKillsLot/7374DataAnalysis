# sorry for such a mess 
Dear TA,
I finished the work on 2017/2/25 and I thought it will just take a minute for me to upload my assignment. However, I tried a lot of times this afternoon and failed like 7 times.
Everything is okay if I simply upload same small files but whrn it comes to "data" file, it just got jammed up.
The git bash always showed signs like another bash is running or just processing.
I attached the problem I ran into and some pictures to show the hierarchy
Moreover, I zip the whole file so that you could check what is in the file.
