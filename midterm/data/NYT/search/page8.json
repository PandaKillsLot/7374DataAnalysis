Beloved son of the late Maria Guarnica Bennett. John was born in Colon, R.P. He spent his childhood in Panama and the idyllic island of San Andres and was brought as a teen to the United States by his beloved uncle Edward Platz to live with him, his wife, Guillermina, and their cherished family in Connecticut. John earned his U.S. citizenship in the Army during the Korean War. He studied physics and comparative literature at Columbia University and fell in love with New York City where he lived the rest of his life. A serious collector of books, music and art, both natural and man-made, John's library exceeded 40,000 books. He was also an accomplished, award winning photographer. John had an insatiable interest in, and knowledge of, literature, music, art and the sciences ... a true \"Renaissance Man.\" Hired by IBM as one of their early technicians for the first commercial computer, John worked for IBM in various capacities for 36 years. A renowned IBM instructor, John loved teaching and was consistently praised by his students as their \"best teacher ever.\" He could make any subject interesting, and fascinated friends and family with erudite, off the cuff lectures on almost any topic requested. John loved travel and exploring the culture and natural beauty of the U.S., Europe, Africa, the Far East and Latin America. But he enjoyed most being with friends and family. Generous and caring, John was beloved by all who knew him. He was without doubt Shakespeare's\"prince among men.\" He will be sorely missed. Viewing at Noon, memorial service at 1pm on Thursday, January 8th at the Fred H. McGrath & Son, Funeral Home, 20 Cedar St., Bronxville, NY.
